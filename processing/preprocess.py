    """
    Preprocess an ECG signal by applying optional detrending and filters.

    The preprocessing pipeline consists of:
        1. NaN checking.
        2. Optional polynomial detrending.
        3. Optional high-pass filtering.
        4. Optional notch filtering.
        5. Optional low-pass filtering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ecg_signal : np.ndarray
        The raw ECG signal (1D array). May contain NaNs.
    sampling_rate : int or float
        Sampling rate of the ECG signal in Hz.
    highpass_cutoff : float, optional
        High-pass filter cutoff frequency in Hz. If None, high-pass filter is skipped.
    filter_order : int, optional
        Filter order for Butterworth filters. Required for high/low-pass filters.
    lowpass_cutoff : float, optional
        Low-pass filter cutoff frequency in Hz. If None, low-pass filter is skipped.
    notch_frequency : float, optional
        Frequency in Hz for notch filtering (e.g., 50 or 60 Hz). If None, skipped.
    quality_factor : float, optional
        Quality factor for notch filter. Required if `notch_frequency` is set.
    poly_degree : int, optional
        Degree of polynomial for detrending. If None, detrending is skipped.
    max_nan_frac : float, default=0.05
        Maximum allowable fraction of NaN values for interpolation (e.g., 0.01 = 1%).

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray or None
        Preprocessed ECG signal as a 1D NumPy array, or None if preprocessing fails.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the NaN fraction exceeds `max_nan_frac` or all samples are NaN.
