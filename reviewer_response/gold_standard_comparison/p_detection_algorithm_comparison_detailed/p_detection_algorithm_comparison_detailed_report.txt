P Detection Algorithm Comparison (Detailed)
================================================================================

Total missed peaks analyzed: 12

1. PEAK DETECTABILITY ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P peak is local extrema in raw signal: 6/12 (50.0%)
P peak is max/min in search window (raw): 0/12 (0.0%)
P peak is max/min in search window (detrended): 0/12 (0.0%)
P peak is max/min in search window (filtered): 0/12 (0.0%)

2. DERIVATIVE-BASED DETECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derivative-based detection found peak (raw): 3/12 (25.0%)
Derivative-based detection found peak (detrended): 0/12 (0.0%)

3. KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠ 6 peaks are NOT local extrema
⚠ Derivative-based detection misses 12 peaks
  → Detection algorithm has issues with these peak morphologies

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Investigate why derivative-based detection misses some peaks
2. Analyze peak morphologies that are missed
3. Consider alternative detection methods for these cases
