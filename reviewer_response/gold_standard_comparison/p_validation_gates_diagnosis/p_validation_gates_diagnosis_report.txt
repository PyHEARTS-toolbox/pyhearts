1. VALIDATION GATE FAILURE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
temporal_pr_distance:
  Passed: 12/12 (100.0%)
  Failed: 0/12 (0.0%)

temporal_pq_distance:
  Passed: 12/12 (100.0%)
  Failed: 0/12 (0.0%)

amplitude_ratio:
  Passed: 11/12 (91.7%)
  Failed: 1/12 (8.3%)
  Rejection reasons:
    - P/R ratio 0.0241 < 0.03

snr_gate:
  Passed: 12/12 (100.0%)
  Failed: 0/12 (0.0%)

training_threshold:
  Passed: 12/12 (100.0%)

morphology_validation:
  Passed: 11/12 (91.7%)
  Failed: 1/12 (8.3%)
  Rejection reasons:
    - Failed morphology validation (likely Q peak)

2. OVERALL ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
